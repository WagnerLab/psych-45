# 4/18: MiA #1: Working Memory

We will have you complete two different types of working memory tasks. The first is the classic “N-Back” task. In this task, you will indicate whether or not any given item in a sequence of items matches the one presented “N” items ago. In the n-back tasks we’ll have you complete, you’ll experience the 1-back, 2-back, 3-back, and 4-back versions of the task. Then, the second task you’ll complete is the classic Sternberg working memory task. 

The specific instructions for each task are explained in detail at each demo link (below).

For both tasks, you must use a laptop or desktop computer (not a mobile phone or tablet), and you must use either **Google Chrome or Firefox** for the task to work.

*Importantly: after finishing each of the two tasks below, you will be prompted to press a key on your keyboard to download your data file (in the .csv format). You will need to download and submit this file (one for the n-back task, and one of the Sternberg task) along with your responses to the three prompts below on Canvas to receive credit. Note that your response to each prompt should be brief (just a few sentences).*

**Step 1:** Please complete the n-back tasks here: <br />[https://wagnerlab.github.io/psych-45/mia-demos/nback.html](https://wagnerlab.github.io/psych-45/mia-demos/nback.html){:target="_blank"}

**Step 2:** Once you’ve completed the n-back tasks, then complete the Sternberg task here:
[https://wagnerlab.github.io/psych-45/mia-demos/sternberg.html](https://wagnerlab.github.io/psych-45/mia-demos/sternberg.html){:target="_blank"}


1. What strategies did you use to try and remember the letters in the n-back task? Did you change your strategies as the N increased? How well did these strategies work for you?
2. Now, compare and contrast the N-back task with the Sternberg task. What was different between them, and how did you have to adapt your strategies to complete this task compared to the n-back tasks?
3. How could you change each task to make them easier or harder, other than changing the number of targets (i.e., N for N-back, or the number of items you were presented during each trial of the Sternberg)?

> To receive credit, please complete the demos, then submit your two data files to the appropriate assignments on Canvas under the *“Assignments” tab (Click "Show By Type" at the top-right corner of the screen) > “MiA #1: Working Memory” group > (‘N-Back Data File Upload’; ‘Sternberg Data File Upload’), as well as your answers to these prompts on Canvas (‘Responses to Prompts’)* **by no later than 9:00 AM PDT on Monday (4/17).**

# 4/20: MiA #2: Stroop

A demo of the classic Stroop task can be found by navigating here: [http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/selftests/stroopeffects.html](http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/selftests/stroopeffects.html){:target="_blank"}

First, complete the task at the top of the page titled “The easy practice test”. Then, complete the task below it titled “The real hard test”. Here, for each task, you will name, **_out loud_**, the color that the word is printed in (not what the word actually is). For instance, if you see <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">PURPLE</span>, you would say “RED” out loud because the word ‘purple’ is printed in red-colored ink.

Importantly, please make sure you time your responses for each of the two tasks by clicking the “Start” button when you are ready to begin, and then clicking the “Finish” button when you are done. **Please submit these elapsed times (secs) to this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFO8K0iU7sposeaicJ6BRe7_pHoKIbkXbL36oc_TOtD4YKxg/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"}**. Finally, please provide brief responses (just a few sentences) to the below prompts on Canvas.

1. Were you as quick and accurate on all of the trials? Or were some trials easier than others? Why do you think this might be the case?
2. Did the task become easier over time?
3. Do you think the effect would be larger or smaller if, instead of identifying the color that color words were printed in, you were identifying the font that different font names were printed in? What about numbers in different font sizes? Explain your thinking?
4. Is there an example of the Stroop effect you’ve observed in the real world?

> To receive credit, please complete the demo, then submit your response times to the Google Form (linked above), and your answers to these prompts on Canvas under the *“Assignments” tab (Click "Show By Type" at the top-right corner of the screen) > “MiA #2: Stroop” group > (‘Responses to Prompts’)* **by no later than 9:00 AM PDT on Wednesday (4/19).**

# 4/25: MiA #3: Semantic Memory

First, go to this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5rVw2kGnnm23ovx7LtGYzMdVhLERneUVW4UqJs4PLFHLazQ/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"} and complete the category ranking task. Then please provide brief responses (just a few sentences) to the below prompts on Canvas.

1. Briefly describe the strategy that you used (or that you think you used) to make these decisions.
2. Choose one of the categories (i.e., fruit, sport, bird, vehicle, crime, vegetable), and list what you consider the most important defining features of that category to be.

> To receive credit, please complete the task on the Google Form (linked above), and then submit your responses to these prompts on Canvas under the *“Assignments” tab (Click "Show By Type" at the top-right corner of the screen) > “MiA #3: Semantic Memory” group > (‘Responses to Prompts’)* **by no later than 9:00 AM PDT on Monday (4/24)**.

# 5/30: MiA #4: Emotion & Memory

First, complete the demo here: <br /> [https://wagnerlab.github.io/psych-45/mia-demos/emo.html](https://wagnerlab.github.io/psych-45/mia-demos/emo.html){:target="_blank"}.
You must use a laptop or desktop computer (not a mobile phone or tablet), and it’s recommended that you use **Google Chrome** for the task to work properly.

After completing the demo, you’ll see a summary screen. Click “Submit Results!” – you’ll be presented with data to copy & paste; please submit these data on this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRODUjfXMlluJXC99nOrb5pccIVmrh63w-0xI9SRzXwHU11A/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"}. Then please provide brief responses (just a few sentences) to the below prompts on Canvas.

1. What type of encoding instructions were used? What type of memory test was used? Based on what we’ve learned about this type of memory test, what serial positions are you more likely to remember when performing this type of task?
2. How was your memory performance for the different types (positive, negative, neutral) of words? Why do you think this was the case? Did you use different encoding and/or retrieval strategies for the different types of words?
3. (Optional). Feel free to share any additional comments.

> To receive credit, please submit your data on the Google Form (linked above), as well as your answers to these prompts on Canvas under the *“Assignments” tab (Click "Show By Type" at the top-right corner of the screen) > “MiA #4: Emotion & Memory” group > (‘Responses to Prompts’)* **by no later than 9:00 AM PDT on Monday (5/29).**

# 6/1: MiA #5: Memory Errors

For two days keep a “memory errors” journal. Try to pay attention to situations in your life where your memory has failed you over these two days, being particularly attentive to failures that you might not usually notice. Ask yourself: Why did my memory behave this way? Were there certain types of circumstances that produced these errors? What could I have done to prevent the errors from happening?

Try to think of at least one instance of each of the following:

1. Forgetting
2. False memory

> To receive credit, please submit whatever examples of errors that you feel comfortable sharing from your journal on Canvas under the *“Assignments” tab (Click "Show By Type" at the top-right corner of the screen) > “MiA #5: Memory Errors” group > (‘Journal’)* **by no later than 9:00 AM PDT on Wednesday (5/31).**
