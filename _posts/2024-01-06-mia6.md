title: "MiA #6: False Memory (Due 5/29)"
---

> **Due no later than 9:00 AM PDT on Wednesday (5/29).**

For two days keep a “memory errors” journal. Try to pay attention to situations in your life where your memory has failed you over these two days, being particularly attentive to failures that you might not usually notice. Ask yourself: Why did my memory behave this way? Were there certain types of circumstances that produced these errors? What could I have done to prevent the errors from happening?

Try to think of at least one instance of each of the following:

1. Forgetting
2. False memory

✅ To receive credit, please submit whatever examples of errors that you feel comfortable sharing from your journal on Canvas (assignment: MiA #6 - Memory Errors Journal)
