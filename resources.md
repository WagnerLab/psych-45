## Visualizing The Brain
[BrainVoyager Brain Tutor](http://www.brainvoyager.com/downloads/downloads.html){:target="_blank"}
- Must be downloaded (40 mbs for mac version)
- Basic tool for learning gross neuroanatomy

[Scalable Brain Atlas](http://scalablebrainatlas.incf.org/main/coronal3d.php?template=LPBA40_on_SRI24&){:target="_blank"}
- More advanced tool
- Allows viewers to ‘see’ specific regions across slices of the brain

[Neurosynth](http://neurosynth.org/){:target="_blank"}
- Meta analysis tool that allows users to view most commonly reported locations for given terms like ‘memory’ or ‘cognitive control’, or to view words most associated with activation in a region (these words tend to be either psychological constructs or anatomical labels)
- This is a fun tool, but remember that we are dealing with (possibly noisy) aggregation across studies
