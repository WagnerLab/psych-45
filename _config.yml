  Everything we know is derived from and reflects memory for our past. Memories, be they of the recent or more distant past, inform current thinking and action, and enable planning for the future. This course provides an introductory survey of the literature on learning and memory, including consideration of the cognitive and neural organization of memory, mechanisms of remembering and forgetting, and the nature of false memories. Cognitive theory and behavioral evidence will be integrated with data from patient studies and functional brain imaging.
